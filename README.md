# System Programming Lab 2 - fork+exec, wait
## Task A
Write a program `domath.c` and compile it as `domath`. The program should accept two arguments, create four child processes and pass the arguments to the child processes. Each of the child processes will perfom a math operation over the arguments (+, -, *, /) as shown below.

```bash
$ gcc domath.c -o domath
$ ./domath 3 5
child1: 3+5=8
child3: 3*5=15
child2: 3-5=-2
child4: 3/5=0
parent: done.
```
